## 📋 Summary

The EcoGuard AI package is now fully configured for automated publishing to PyPI with a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline and version management system.

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 1. Automated CI/CD Publishing Pipeline
- **Complete CI/CD workflow** with build, test, and publish jobs
- **Trusted publishing setup** using OIDC for enhanced security
- **Dual publishing strategy**: Test PyPI for main branch, production PyPI for tags
- **Build verification** and package validation before publishing

### 2. Manual Release Workflow
- **GitHub Actions workflow** for controlled releases
- **Automatic version bumping** in pyproject.toml and CLI
- **Full test suite execution** before release
- **Git tag creation** and GitHub release generation
- **Automated release notes** with commit history

### 3. Version Management Tools
- **Python script** (`scripts/version.py`) for programmatic version management
- **Shell script** (`scripts/manage-version.sh`) for easy command-line access
- **Version validation** and semantic versioning support
- **Test and lint integration** before version updates

### 4. Comprehensive Documentation
- **Publishing Guide** (`docs/PUBLISHING.md`) - Complete workflow documentation
- **PyPI Setup Guide** (`docs/PYPI_SETUP.md`) - Step-by-step trusted publisher configuration
- **Updated README** with publishing and version management sections
- **Security best practices** and troubleshooting guides

## 🚀 Current Workflow Status

### Automated Publishing (Ready)
```yaml
✅ CI/CD Pipeline: .github/workflows/ci.yml
✅ Release Workflow: .github/workflows/release.yml
✅ Build Job: Package building and verification
✅ Publish Job: Trusted publishing to PyPI
✅ Environment Protection: release environment configured
```

### Version Management (Ready)
```bash
✅ Current Version Check: ./scripts/manage-version.sh current
✅ Version Bumping: ./scripts/manage-version.sh bump [patch|minor|major]
✅ Version Setting: ./scripts/manage-version.sh set X.Y.Z
✅ Full Release: ./scripts/manage-version.sh release X.Y.Z
✅ Project Status: ./scripts/manage-version.sh status
```

## 📝 Next Steps Required (Manual Configuration)

### 1. PyPI Trusted Publisher Setup
**Action Required**: Configure trusted publishers on PyPI websites

**Test PyPI**: https://test.pypi.org/manage/account/publishing/
- Project Name: `ecoguard-ai`
- Owner: `your-github-username`
- Repository: `ecoguard`
- Workflow: `ci.yml`
- Environment: `release`

**Production PyPI**: https://pypi.org/manage/account/publishing/
- Same configuration as Test PyPI

### 2. GitHub Environment Creation
**Action Required**: Create `release` environment in GitHub repository

1. Go to Repository Settings → Environments
2. Create new environment: `release`
3. Add protection rules:
   - Restrict to `main` branch
   - Optional: Add required reviewers

### 3. Initial Package Upload (First Time)
**Option A**: Use temporary API token for first upload
**Option B**: Manual upload with twine

After first successful upload, trusted publishing will work automatically.

## 🧪 Testing the Pipeline

### Test PyPI Publishing
```bash
# Push to main branch
git push origin main
# Check: https://test.pypi.org/project/ecoguard-ai/
```

### Production PyPI Publishing
```bash
# Create and push version tag
git tag v0.1.4
git push origin v0.1.4
# Check: https://pypi.org/project/ecoguard-ai/
```

### Manual Release (Recommended)
```bash
# Use GitHub Actions Release workflow
# Actions → Release → Run workflow → Enter version
```
